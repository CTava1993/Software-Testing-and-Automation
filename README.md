~How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

My best answer for this would be to follow coding standards while coding, adhere to KISS (Keep It Short and Simple) if possible. The more unnecessary complexity you add, the more likely you are to run into issues. As for ensuring functionality, remember the requirements. Functional and non-functional requirements are paramount to understanding if your project is literally functional. Proper QA that is nonexhaustive would be the key.


~How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

This is sort of hard to explain, but a lot of what goes into interpreting user needs falls down to your communication skills. If we go back to determining requirements, you need to interpret what they are asking for in a simple and effective way that can be broken down into key points for the rest of the team. This is only half of the battle, since the rest of it is a continual process to ensure that development follows up on the defined user requirements that you define. Like I said, communication is the big part here.


~How do I approach designing software?

I would combine prompt 1 and prompt 2 for this. Ultimately how you design software depends upon the situation, considering the approach can vary in so many different ways. But to summarize, keep it short and simple, adhere to coding safety standards, and define proper requirements for a project and develop good communication skills to ensure that they are implemented into development effectively.
